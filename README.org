* Luister

Luister is a simple web-based music library.

I used to be a music blogger and have a very large library of mp3 and
ogg files. Regular music library software doesn't do what I want/need
it to, so I've gone through a few iterations of my own. This is the
latest. [[https://github.com/thraxil/maut/][maut]] was the previous.

This version is written in Go, uses [[https://github.com/thraxil/cask/][cask]] to store the actual files,
and uses [[https://www.cockroachlabs.com/][CockroachDB]] for the metadata.

I run it locally and access it through a browser. Not much more to say
about it.

It's pretty specific to my needs. If you're looking for music library
software, this probably isn't what you want.
